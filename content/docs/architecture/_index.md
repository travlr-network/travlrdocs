TravlrNode implements a modular, plugin-based architecture that enables flexible integration with different blockchain platforms, storage solutions, and networking protocols. The system is designed around core principles of decentralization, security, and scalability.

### Core Architecture Principles

- **Modularity**: All major components are plugin-based, allowing easy replacement and extension
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure or central authority
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption and granular access control
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through P2P networking
- **Interoperability**: Support for multiple blockchain platforms and protocols
